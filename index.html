        <h4>Song Lyrics</h4>

        <ul>
           <li>[Verse 1]<br>
            We couldn't turn around<br>
            'Til we were upside down<br>
            I'll be the bad guy now<br>
            But, no, I ain't too proud<br>
          <br>
            <li>[Chorus]<br>
                Seasons change and our love went cold<br>
                Feed the flame 'cause we can't let go<br>
                Run away but we're running in circles<br>
                Run away, run away<br>
                I couldn't be there<br>
                Even when I tried<br>
                You don't believe it<br>
                We do this every time<br>
            </li>

            <li>I dare you to do something<br>
                I'm waiting on you again<br>
                So I don't take the blame<br>
                Run away, but we're running in circles<br>
                Run away, run away, run away<br>
           <br>
          <li>[Verse 2]<br>
            Let go<br>
            I got a feeling that it's time to let go<br>
            I say so<br>
            I knew that this was doomed from the get-go<br>
        </li>
        <li>You thought that it was special, special<br>
            But it was just the sex though, the sex though<br>
            And I still hear the echoes (the echoes)<br>
            I got a feeling that it's time to let it go, let it go<br>
        <br>
        <li>[Chorus]<br>
            Seasons change and our love went cold<br>
            Feed the flame 'cause we can't let it go<br>
            Run away, but we're running in circles<br>
            Run away, run away<br>
        </li>
        <li>I dare you to do something<br>
            I'm waiting on you again<br>
            So I don't take the blame<br>
            Run away, but we're running in circles<br>
            Run away, run away, run away<br>
        <br>
        <li>[Bridge]<br>
            Maybe you don't understand what I'm going through<br>
            It's only me<br>
            What you got to lose?<br>
            Make up your mind, tell me<br>
            What are you gonna do?<br>
            It's only me<br>
            Let it go<br>
        
        <br>
        <li>[Chorus]<br>
            Seasons change and our love went cold<br>
            Feed the flame 'cause we can't let it go<br>
            Run away, but we're running in circles<br>
            Run away, run away<br>
        </li>
        <li>I dare you to do something<br>
            I'm waiting on you again<br>
            So I don't take the blame<br>
            Run away, but we're running in circles<br>
            Run away, run away, run away<br>
        </li>
